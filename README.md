# graphql-node

This repository contains an implementation of a GraphQL server (created with graphql-yoga) that uses Prisma 2 as a data layer to a mySQL
database. It follows the tutorial from [How To GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/) which involves creating a
backend for a blog app. 

This app allows people to create users and authenticate (using JWT), add links for the blog as well as let users to vote for links they like.
This was meant to solidify learning of key GraphQL components.
